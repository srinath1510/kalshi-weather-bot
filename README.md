# Kalshi Weather Bot

A Python bot that finds trading edges in Kalshi's NYC Daily High Temperature markets.


It aggregates weather forecasts (NWS, Open-Meteo), tracks live station data from Central Park (KNYC), and uses a probability engine to tell you when the market is wrong.

## How It Works

1.  **Reads the Weather**: Pulls forecasts from GFS, ECMWF, and NWS.
2.  **Watches the Sky**: Tracks real-time temperature at Central Park.
3.  **Computes Odds**: Calculates the probability of every Kalshi bracket winning.
4.  **Finds Edges**: Compares its math vs. the market price to find profitable trades.

## Quick Start

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

2.  Run the dashboard:
    ```bash
    python -m kalshi_weather run
    ```

### Settlement Command

View official settlement temperatures from NWS Daily Climate Reports (the same source Kalshi uses):
